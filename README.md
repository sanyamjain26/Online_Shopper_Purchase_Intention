## Project Title: Predicting Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention

### Overview
The project aims to analyze the Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset to understand and predict the purchasing behavior of online shoppers. The dataset contains ten numerical and eight categorical attributes, with a total of approximately 12,330 sessions. The variables relate to different aspects such as the type of visitor, whether the visit was on a weekday or weekend, the month of the visit, and so forth. The “Revenue” attribute is a binary variable that indicates whether or not the session concluded with a transaction.

### Importance of the Project
Online shopping has revolutionized the way consumers purchase products, generating a significant amount of data. Analyzing this dataset is crucial as it can provide vital insights into customers' online behavior and purchasing patterns. Understanding these patterns can lead to more effective marketing strategies, better customer service, and improved overall business performance.

### Key Findings
- Approximately 85% of the sessions did not result in a purchase, whereas around 15% of sessions led to a transaction.
- Returning visitors accounted for approximately 86% of sessions, indicating that most online shopping is done by users who have previously interacted with the site.
- The month, the type of visitor, and the time spent on the website may be correlated with the likelihood of a purchase being made.

### Solution
- **Features Used**: The analysis focused on features such as “ProductRelated”, “ProductRelated_Duration”, “BounceRates”, “ExitRates”, “PageValues”, “VisitorType”, “Weekend”, and “Month” to understand user behavior during browsing sessions.
- **Classifiers Used**: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Classifier, KNN model, Logistic Regression, and Neural Network were employed to predict purchasing behavior.
- **Summary of Results**: The models performed reasonably well in predicting whether a session would end in a purchase or not. The best-performing model was the Gradient Boosting Classifier with an accuracy of 91%.

### Conclusion
The findings reinforce the idea that understanding customer interactions with product pages and their session quality are key to predicting online purchase intentions. However, it is important to note that machine learning models are probabilistic and work on patterns in the dataset. These interpretations should be used in conjunction with other business insights to form a comprehensive strategy.
